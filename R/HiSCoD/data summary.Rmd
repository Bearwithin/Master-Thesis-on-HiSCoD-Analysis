This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.







```{r}
summary(data$id)
```
21k data




```{r}
summary(data$year)
summary(data$month_num)
summary(data$day)
```
most to days, good.



```{r}

number_parti <- data$nb_participants
number_parti_modi <- as.numeric(number_parti)

summary(number_parti_modi)
```
16000NA, mean 237, med 24, Q3 108.


```{r}
women_parti <-data$women_participation


women_parti_modi <- ifelse(women_parti == "No", 0, women_parti)
women_parti_modi <- ifelse(women_parti_modi == "Yes", 1, women_parti_modi)
women_parti_modi <- as.numeric(women_parti_modi)

summary(women_parti_modi)
```
11335NA, more than half yes


```{r}
city_code <- data$city_code
city_code <- as.numeric(city_code)
city_code_new <- data$code_insee_pre_2016
city_code_new <- as.numeric(city_code_new)

summary(city_code)
summary(city_code_new)

```
4068 no city code   and 6809 for code of insee
city code have some E123456   but not for insee code


```{r}
summary(data$city_latitude)
summary(data$city_longitude)
```
5dp and 6dp
203 no location, and seems like location is the same with same city code?
but question here

```{r}
summary(data$geo_precision)
```
what's that means?



```{r}
length(table(data$city_latitude))
length(table(data$city_code))

```



```{r}
table(data$country_name)
length(table(data$country_name))
```
15813 France, 3423 England, and other, 20 blank

```{r}
table(data$admin_level_1_type)
table(data$admin_level_2_type)
```
seems like not useful and no information(region and department)




```{r}
table(data$historical_political_entity)
```
better than above, 10000+France, 2650 GB, and other(like so many France)

```{r}
table(data$historical_admin_level_1_type)
table(data$historical_admin_level_2_type)
```
good things to know, but not really understand.
share some same type, but level2 have more blanks(6k 2k) and less information
